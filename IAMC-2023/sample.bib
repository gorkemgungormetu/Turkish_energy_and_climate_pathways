abstract = {Final energy demand in Turkey is increasing together with increasing domestic production causing carbon emissions from the energy sector to increase considerably Atmospheric carbon concentration has increased at an unprecedented rate since industrialization raising concerns for climate change and potential climate extreme events in the world Although Turkey is highly vulnerable to climate change together with other countries in the Mediterranean region, there is less ambition in the national contribution declaration with reduction pledge from business-as-usual emissions conditional to increasing access to financing mechanisms Nuclear energy is mentioned in the national contribution as an option for climate change mitigation together with focus areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency and market mechanisms However, the potential roles of these individual areas related to energy transition pathways for Turkey are not defined in the national contribution Here we present an analytical model for energy transition pathways of Turkey from 2015 to 2035 based on global socio-economic scenarios and energy system costs Our results demonstrate that the potential role of nuclear energy for climate change mitigation in the Turkish energy sector is sensitive to decreasing costs of renewable energy and increasing costs of nuclear power plants The intermittency of solar and wind power results in the convergence of their electricity generation by the end of the modelling period in order to preserve capacity reserves for grid stability Nuclear energy contributes to climate change mitigation in the energy sector for SSP2 middle-of-the-road pathway together with renewable energy under moderate energy efficiency improvements The contribution of nuclear energy depends on the capital costs of renewable energy technologies for SSP1 taking the green road pathway with ambitious energy efficiency improvements We further discuss the results with expert elicitation on global, national and individual contexts for environmental behavior (author)},
